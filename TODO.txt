CURRENT ISSUES:
If compiling with Arduino Core 2.x and WiFi ENABLED (either for debug or DCS Operation) there could be "conflicts"
and/or interference, however, this seems to only happen with Arduino Core 2.x. (3.x is fine). This should not be an
issue as WiFi is supposed to be DISABLED for production and if you need Networked panels you are better off using the
HID manager python script on a remote computer (Windows/Linux/Mac/Raspberry Pi) which automatically enables your panels
over the network. A way to reproduce the issue is: Compile the MAIN_PANEL label set with Arduino Core 2.x and WiFi
enabled, notice the Lockshoot indicator staying WHITE. It stops working. Just disable WiFi and it will work again. This is most likely a WiFI/RMT conflict issue/bug in Arduino Core 2.x

- HID Handler edge cases (replicate starting the computer or resuming from sleep with device already connected)

- HID Manager Headless + C++ version

- Keep testing panel sync to ensure 100% reliability

- Front Left and Front Right panel implementations (Physical)

- KY-58 Panel implementation (Physical)

- Make WS2812 generic and modify panel struct/union to add index characteristics (color). Device instance should be deduced from the DIO pin.

- Test UART for Serial coms on S3's and C3's simultaneously with USB HIDs (using HID keepalives). To test stability. use DCSBIOS with the hardware CDC option

IFEI - Dirty on mode 888 Change so we force an update

IFEI - init on Momentaries with 0 messes up the IFEI as some buttons actions are "on release" meaning, ACTION = 0. Skip momentaries during init. and TEST with IFEI and ALR67. Should auto-detect latched buttons in ALR67.  test both scenarios

Simplify config. Pins, Special Rules, Remove Mappings.h/cpp from root, should be Core now.

Test compiling on 2.0.4 and using analog on IR Cool. Check range
