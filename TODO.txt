TODO:

- HID Handler edge cases (replicate starting the computer or resuming from sleep with device already connected)

- Keep testing panel sync to ensure 100% reliability with SAFE/ARM test

- Front Right panel implementations (Physical) - Implemented hook LED. Hook + Wing Fold. Implement Backlight

Test TMR axes on BLE device

H2 behavior with HWCDC is weird.. maybe its ARDUINO_USB_MODE is neither 1 or 0?

HID axes with filtering acting weird (snap to corner)

Axes need to be also rate limited? or on top of loop (see Generic's loop function)
