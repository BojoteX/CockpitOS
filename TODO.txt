CURRENT ISSUES:
If compiling with Arduino Core 2.x and WiFi ENABLED (either for debug or DCS Operation) there could be "conflicts"
and/or interference, however, this seems to only happen with Arduino Core 2.x. (3.x is fine). This should not be an
issue as WiFi is supposed to be DISABLED for production and if you need Networked panels you are better off using the
HID manager python script on a remote computer (Windows/Linux/Mac/Raspberry Pi) which automatically enables your panels
over the network. A way to reproduce the issue is: Compile the MAIN_PANEL label set with Arduino Core 2.x and WiFi
enabled, notice the Lockshoot indicator staying WHITE. It stops working. Just disable WiFi and it will work again. This is most likely a WiFI/RMT conflict issue/bug in Arduino Core 2.x

- HID Handler edge cases (replicate starting the computer or resuming from sleep with device already connected)

- Keep testing panel sync to ensure 100% reliability with SAFE/ARM test

- Front Right panel implementations (Physical) - Implemented hook LED. Hook + Wing Fold. Implement Backlight

connect both hubs to raspberry (perf test) 
Implement inactivity automatic deep sleep after x minutes to conserve battery
Test axes on BLE device
